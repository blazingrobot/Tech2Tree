            <p> A wave of environmental action is sweeping across Davao City as the Tech2Trees initiative continues to
                gain momentum, inspiring communities to recycle e-waste in exchange for planting trees. Since its
                launch, the website—designed to promote responsible disposal of electronic waste—has led to a dramatic
                increase in both tree planting and recycling efforts, with thousands of mangrove trees now rooted along
                the city’s coastline.
                In a recent coastal restoration event, over 3,000 mangrove saplings were planted by volunteers from ASEZ
                WAO, a global youth group known for its climate action campaigns. Participants donned light blue and
                yellow vests as they worked together to rehabilitate the shoreline, reinforcing the city’s natural
                defenses against erosion and storm surges.
                This event marks one of many community-led efforts fueled by Tech2Trees, a platform that allows users to
                dispose of old phones, laptops, and other electronics in exchange for tree planting credits. According
                to organizers, the program has already facilitated the recycling of over 5,000 kilograms of e-waste
                since its inception, with each device contributing to the planting of up to 20 trees, depending on its
                condition and recyclability.
                “The response has been overwhelming,” said Tech2Trees coordinator Maria Liza Fernandez. “People are not
                only decluttering their homes—they’re actively restoring ecosystems. It’s a win-win for both the
                environment and the community.”
                The initiative has partnered with local recyclers and tree-planting organizations to ensure transparency
                and impact. Users can track their contributions through the website, viewing updates on where their
                trees are planted and how their recycled devices are processed.
                Environmental groups like IDIS (Interfacing Development Interventions for Sustainability) have praised
                the program for bridging digital waste management with climate resilience. “Tech2Trees is a model for
                how tech and sustainability can work hand in hand,” said IDIS spokesperson Rafael Cruz.
                As Davao continues to face challenges from climate change and urban waste, programs like Tech2Trees
                offer a hopeful path forward—one tree, one device at a time.
